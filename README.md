# Hi there 👋

My name's Alex, I'm a novice in the world of coding.
I recently started to learn from Le Campus Numérique in The Alps in Annecy. 8 months of a FullStack curriculum, from October 2025 to June 2026. Then an apprenticeship of a year in a company

## Projects
I'm currently working on a personnal project that I will share when I will be ready to.
This project aimed to be a combo with a website and a mobile app. Still not sure which stack I should use but gradually reducing my scope to few languages/framework.
More to come soon.

Otherwise, school projects (PHP, Laravel, JavaScript) that I'm currently improving. You can already have a look a them on my Public Repo.
A lot to improve, but I grinding for it !

## Stack
🌱 I'm no master in any languages/framework yet. Doing my best to improve the following skills:

Frontend
Webiste
- For now, JS/CSS/HTML but aiming for Vue.js.
- It seems to be a good choice as it is well used and documented.
- Also My school program will lead me to a 2/3 weeks course on it. Starting soon.

Mobile App
- Interested with React Native
- Earing some nice stuff from Flutter as well...
- Difficult choice but we have to start somewhere at some point.
---
Backend:
- I am familiar with PHP and Laravel as we made two projects with it at the campus.
- Learn a lot about MVC model and the way a backend works.
- Python and Java/Java Spirnt are next in the list. (Can't wait !)
- Honestly thrilling to go deeper into this type of field.

Database > 
- Learning SQL (MySQL) / No SQL (MongoDB).
- Learning PostgreSQL following the freecodecamp.org curriculum

---

I'm looking forward to this journey in this amazing community, and I'll try to participate to Open Source project as soon as I will be a bit more confident in my skills.
Please, contact me if you have any question or if you would like I join you in a side quest !

Best,
Alex
